Soprano Mireille Asselin, hailed for her “crystalline voice” and “abundant charm,” continues to build an already exciting career in 2017-2018. A return to her native Canada, for Susanna in _Le Nozze di Figaro_ with Opera Atelier, precedes her fifth season at the Metropolitan Opera, where she covers Valencienne in _The Merry Widow_. Ms. Asselin “stole the show” in her 2015 Met debut as Adele in _Die Fledermaus_, conducted by James Levine.

A champion of contemporary music, Ms. Asselin is also developing the role of Eleanor of Aquitaine in _Sanctuary and Storm_, a new opera for Re:Naissance Opera in Toronto, with preview performances planned for January 2018. In April 2018, she makes a role and company debut as Eurydice in Opera Columbus’s new production of Gluck’s _Orphée et Eurydice_ (in the Berlioz version), adding to an operatic repertoire that includes such roles as Pamina, Nannetta, Musetta, and Thérèse (Poulenc’s _Les Mamelles de Tirésias_).

During the 2016-2017 Metropolitan Opera season, Ms. Asselin covered the roles of Jemmy in _Guillaume Tell_ and Rosina in _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_. Audiences at Opera Atelier and the Royal Opera of the Palace of Versailles saw her as Créuse in Charpentier’s _Medée_. She also made notable concert debuts with the Minnesota Orchestra, in Handel’s _Messiah_, and with Boston’s Handel and Haydn Society, as Iris in _Semele_.

Appropriately for such a versatile artist, Ms. Asselin’s concert and recital dates in 2017-2018 include a Boston recital of travel songs by Barber, Berlioz, and others in September, and a debut in November with the North Carolina Symphony, singing the soprano solos in Mozart’s Requiem and the Vaughan Williams _Pastoral Symphony_. In February 2018, she joins members of the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra, dancers from Opera Atelier, and others, in Toronto for a reprise of _Harmonia Sacra_, a recital of sacred works by Purcell. The group first performed this highly successful program in May 2017 in the Palace of Versailles in France.
