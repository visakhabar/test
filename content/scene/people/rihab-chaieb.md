Acclaimed for her dramatic charm and vocal clarity, Tunisian-born Rihab Chaieb is a recent graduate of the Metropolitan Opera’s Lindemann Young Artist Program and increasingly a name of note in the lyric mezzo-soprano repertoire. 

A former member of both the Canadian Opera Company’s Ensemble Studio, where she earned major acclaim as Sesto in Mozart's _La clemenza di Tito_, and San Francisco Opera’s Merola Opera Program, where she debuted as Cherubino in _Le nozze di Figaro_, Chaieb has also enjoyed several summers at the Glyndebourne Festival: as Mércedès in David McVicar’s production of Bizet's _Carmen_ with Jakub Hrůša, and subsequently as Flora in Verdi’s _La traviata_ with Andrés Orozco-Estrada. After an acclaimed Metropolitan Opera debut as Zulma in Rossini's _L’italiana in Algeri_, Rihab Chaieb has returned to that stage as Lola (_Cavalleria rusticana_) under Nicola Luisotti, Laura (_Luisa Miller_) under Bertrand de Billy, and Sandman (_Hänsel und Gretel_) under Donald Runnicles, with performances elsewhere including Tebaldo (_Don Carlo_), marking her debut at l’Opéra National de Bordeaux, and both Juno and Ino in Handel’s _Semele_ in Toronto.

Following her impressive performance at the 2018 Operalia Competition, earning her Third Prize, Chaieb embarks on her first freelance season with debuts as Offenbach’s _Fantasio_ at Opéra et Orchestre National de Montpellier in Thomas Jolly’s acclaimed production, alongside Kasturbai in Philip Glass’ _Satyagraha_ at Opera Vlaanderen. A trio of Mozart roles take Chaieb to Teatro Santiago de Chile (Dorabella), Cincinnati Opera (Cherubino) and back to The Met (Zerlina). Following her creation of the Fairy Prince in the world premiere of David Hertzberg’s _The Wake World_ for Opera Philadelphia last season, Rihab Chaieb makes a company debut with Houston Grand Opera in another world premiere: Tarik O’Regan’s _The Phoenix_, in which she creates the roles of Maria Malibran, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Nancy Da Ponte (née Grahl)

Raised in Canada, Chaieb studied at the Schulich School of Music at McGill University, the Steans Music Institute at the Ravinia Festival, and at the Franz Schubert Institute in Baden bei Wien. The recipient of many major grants, Rihab Chaib has also enjoyed competition success, winning the 2016 Gerda Lissner International Vocal Competition and taking prizes at both the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions and the 2018 George London Foundation Competition. She was a finalist in the 2013 Neue Stimmen Competition and a participant in the 2016 edition of Edith Wiens’ Internationale Meistersinger Akademie in Neumarkt.

With a developing concert repertoire, which includes Vivaldi’s _Magnificat_ and _Gloria_, Pergolesi’s _Stabat Mater_ and Berlioz’s _Les nuits d’été_ among others, Rihab Chaieb made her Carnegie Hall debut singing Bach's _Magnificat_ in December 2016.
