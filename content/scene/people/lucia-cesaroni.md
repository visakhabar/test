Italian-Canadian soprano Lucia Cesaroni had an exciting 2017-2018 season, debuting both soprano roles in _La bohème_: Mimì with Pacific Opera Victoria and Musetta with l’Opéra de Montréal. Her Mimì “was sinuous and seductive. Cesaroni has a gift for projecting movement beyond the footlights and revealed a voice that is smooth, lush and velvety” (Times Colonist). In between Puccini heroines, she sang Eleonora in Donizetti’s rarely performed _L’assedio di Calais_ with Boston’s Odyssey Opera. In her 2018-2019 season she will be heard in the title role of _The Merry Widow_ for Vancouver Opera and Toronto Operetta Theatre and as Violetta in _La traviata_ for Pacific Opera Victoria. Also on her schedule is Adina in _L’elisir d’amore_ for Opera Chengu in China.

Cesaroni’s 2016-17 season included Micaëla in _La tragédie de Carmen_ with the Bay Chamber Concert Series in Maine as well as her Italian debut in _Le nozze di Figaro_ at the renowned Spoleto Festival dei Due Mondi as Mozart’s heroine Susanna, under the baton of James Conlon. She was immediately invited back and sang Donna Anna in a new production of _Don Giovanni_ (also conducted by Conlon) in 2017.

Ms. Cesaroni has been featured with the Royal Philharmonic, the Montreal Symphony, the Aldeburgh Festival, the Victoria Symphony, Opera di Ravenna, Teatro Coccia di Novara, Saskatoon Opera, and VOICEBOX: Opera in Concert, where she created the role of Isis in the world premiere of _Isis and Osiris_ by Togni/Singer.

Hailed by the Globe and Mail’s Robert Harris for her “beautiful, powerful voice \[ably\] capturing a large emotional range with great success”, her roles include Woglinde in _Das Rheingold_, Liù in _Turandot_, Pamina and Erste Dame in _Die Zauberflöte_, Maria in _West Side Story_, Gilda in _Rigoletto_, Juliette in _Roméo et Juliette_, Norina in _Don Pasquale_, Anne Trulove in _The Rake’s Progress_, Cleopatra in _Giulio Cesare_ and Yum-Yum in _The Mikado_. As a concert artist, she has been heard in _Carmina Burana_, and _Messiah_ as well as in recital with Rachel Andrist and Allyson McHardy in their programme celebrating 19th Century bel canto stars, _You’re Welcome, Rossini_.

Born in Toronto and holding a Master’s Degree in Opera from the University of Toronto, she is an Alumna of the Steans Institute at the Ravinia Festival, the Britten-Pears Festival and Young Artists programme.
